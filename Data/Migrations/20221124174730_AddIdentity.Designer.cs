A wolf howls in the distance.Looking around the meager supplies in your backpack, you recall with asigh the days before the mysterious blackout. How much more can yousurvive? Meet THE LONG DARK with its new take on survival and exploration- what Wired magazine called 'the icing on the cake of the entire genre.'The Long Dark is an elaborate survival and exploration game where playerswill have to make their own decisions as they travel through a vast, coldwilderness that has survived a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombiesin it - just you, the cold and what Mother Nature has prepared for you.Part of the first story season of The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE includes twoof its five episodes. In December 2018, in the Redux update, we radicallyredesigned both episodes: we changed the quest system, rewrote the plot,dialogue, animation, and more.EPISODE 1: Long-range pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr.Astrid Greenwood find themselves separated when a mysterious flash oflight causes their plane to crash into the wilds of northern Canada.Desperate to survive and find Astrid, Mackenzie comes to the town ofMilton, where he begins to realize the extent of this silent catastrophe.EPISODE 2: 'Light Fugue' Astrid's search leads Mackenzie deep into thesnow-covered wilderness. Perhaps the mysterious trapper will be able tohelp him, but can he be trusted?The first two episodes of 'WINTERMUTE' take about 15 game hours. The nextthree episodes are included in the price of the game and will be unlockedfor free when released. The characters were voiced by Jennifer Hale, MarkMir, David Hayter and Elias Toufexis (third episode). Music composed byChris Velasco.Survival Mode is a free survival oriented storyless sandbox mode that hasbeen polished for nearly three years in Early Access. Your goal issurvival, and death is the only end of the path. Write your story in everygame.NO HINTS: The game calls for making decisions on their own, providingplayers with information, but not answers.You must earn your right to live.PERMANENT DEATH: At the time of death in survival mode, the saved game willbe deleted.Every decision matters. [In 'WINTERMUTE', the permanent deathfunction is not used.]STATE OF THE ORGANISM AND CALORIES: Keep track of hunger, thirst andtemperature, trying to find a balance between the search for resources andthe forces expended on it.Every action burns calories, and time is your mostvaluable resource.Think before you do anything.LOOK FOR SUPPLIES: Over 100 pieces of gear including tools, lights, weapons,first aid supplies, clothing and more.HUGE LIVING WORLD: Explore 50 square kilometers of the wilderness ofnorthern Canada in search of supplies. In winter. The dynamic change oftime of day, weather, presence of wild animals and other factors onlycomplicates this process.THE FITTEST WILL SURVIVE: Hunt, fish, set traps, climb, draw maps, look forfood and equipment that can save your life, avoid encounters with dangerousanimals, avoid hypothermia, frostbite, dysentery(and other unpleasantcomplications), find and repair equipment.You will face wolves, bears, moose,rabbits, deer, crows and many more in future updates.Hunt them or become prey- it's all up to you.CHOOSE YOUR PATH: Four levels of difficulty give you the opportunity tochoose the level of challenge that suits you, ranging from 'Pilgrim',designed for a calm and thoughtful passage, to 'Intruder', in which eventhe most experienced players will last only a week.If none of them suitsyou - create the one that will be to your liking using the 'Custom Mode'.Music composed by Sasha Dikisian.Several separate challenge modes offer tasks that take 1-3 hours tocomplete. For example, 'Whiteout', where in a limited time you need tocollect enough supplies to survive a terrible snowstorm. Or 'Victim',where you have to run away from a bloodthirsty bear. Complete them tounlock Deeds, long-term upgrades in Survival Mode. There will be fivechallenges available at launch, with more to come.In addition to releasing the three remaining episodes of WINTERMUTE, weplan to keep improving Survival Mode as we always have (we've releasedalmost 100 updates/patches in three years of Early Access). The price ofThe Long Dark includes all five episodes of WINTERMUTE and subsequentsurvival mode updates.SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTERJOIN THE COMMUNITYA LITTLE ABOUT HINTERLAND: Hinterland is a small independent developer oforiginal interactive entertainment.
