<p>How do I adjust my Steam profile privacy settings?</p>

<p>
    There are three states of profile privacy: Public, Friends Only, and Private. Each state has
    additional subcategories to control how you appear to other members of the Steam community.
</p>

<p>
    If you are logged in to Steam, you can change your Privacy Settings by navigating to your
    Profile Privacy Settings Page.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, you can navigate to the Profile Privacy Settings page manually:

    <ol>
        <li>From your Steam Profile, click the Edit Profile link under your displayed badge.</li>
        <li>Click the My Privacy Settings tab</li>
        <li>Select your privacy state (any settings changed are saved automatically)</li>
    </ol>
